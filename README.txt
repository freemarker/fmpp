What is FMPP?
-------------

FMPP is a general-purpose text file preprocessing tool that uses FreeMarker
templates. It process entire directories recursively. It can be used for
generating complete static websites, source code, configuration files, etc.
It can insert data from sources like CSV, XML, and JSON into the generated
files. You can add new kind of data sources in Java.
  
FMPP can be used with UN*X-style command-line interface, or as Ant task, or
can be embedded into your application using its Java API.

FMPP was written in Java, thus it runs on all modern platforms (Windows,
"Linux", OS X, etc.).
