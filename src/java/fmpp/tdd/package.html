  <p>Textual Data Definition related classes.
  TDD is a very simple expression language created for defining hierarchical data
  (vectors, dictionaries) as plain text (maybe a command-line argument).
  Its syntax is similar to FreeMarker expression syntax.
  
  <p>TDD is not for defining large amount of data.
  Rather, it is for give a uniform syntax for simple setting (configuration) values.</p>
