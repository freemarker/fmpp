  <p>FMPP is a general-purpose text file preprocessor tool that uses FreeMarker
  templates. It is especially designed for HTML preprocessor, for the generation
  of complete (static) homepages: directory structure that contains HTML-s,
  image files, etc. FMPP can pull data from external data sources (database,
  XML files, Java property files, etc.) and embed the data into the
  generated files.
  
  <p>For detailed instructions, read the <b>FMPP Manual</b>.
