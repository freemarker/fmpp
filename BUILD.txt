To build FMPP, you will need JDK 5 (or later), and Apache Ant to
be installed.


Building the binary
-------------------

For reproducible builds, it's recommended to copy build.properties.sample into
build.properties and edit it.

To build lib/fmpp.jar: `ant`
To run test suite: `ant test`
To remove earlier build output: `ant clean`


Building the documentation
--------------------------

Preparation (needed only once):
1. Ensure that the "For documentation building" section in build.properties
   is filled properly.
2. Go to http://nodejs.org/ and install node.js (tried with v0.10.32)
3. Go to the FMPP project directory and issue `npm install`

Possible node.js related problems and solutions:
* "Error: ENOENT, stat <someDirectoryHere>": create that directory manually,
  then retry.
* If the system doesn't find `npm`: Open a new terminal (command window) so
  that it pick up the "path" environment variable changes. Adjust it if
  necessary.
* If the build has once worked, but now keeps failing due to some missing
  modules, or anything strange, delete the "node_modules" directory, and
  issue `npm install` to recreate it.

To build the docs: `ant docs`
The output will be be in `build/docs`!

To re-build the FMPP generated part only: `fmpp -C docs.fmpp`
To re-build the Gulp generated part only: `ant docs.gulp`


Making a release
----------------

1. Release to sourcefoge.net:

* Ensure that the version numbers in src/main/java/fmpp/version.properties are
  up to date.

* Ensure that all properties in build.properties are set correctly.
  (Copy build.properties.sample if you don't have build.properties yet.)

* Ensure that the proper version of the dependencies are in the lib
  directory.

* `ant clean test` must pass successfully.

* An extracted FreeMarker release of the proper version must be
  at the location deduced from the build.properties (see
  freemarkerDocs.path in build.xml), as that's where we will
  copy the FreeMarker documentation from.

* Ensure that you haven't polluted the FMPP directories with some
  temporary files (your ad-hoc tests, backups, etc.). Note that typical
  noise like *.bak, *.~*, SVN files, etc. should be filtered out
  automatically by Ant.

* Run "ant clean dist"

* Release the generated tar.gz and zip on sourceforge.net.
  Check their content before that, of course.

2. Release to to the Maven Central Repository
  
* Run `ant maven-dist`.

  Note that unlike sourceforge.net releases, Maven Central Repository
  releases can't ever be redone, so double check everything.

3. Update the Web site:

* The site generation will use the FMPP version number and also
  build/dist/fmpp_x.x.x.tar.gz and zip, so be sure that these are
  there correct. If have just built the release with `ant dist`, then it
  shouldn't be a problem.
  
  Note: The download link will use the download system of sourceforge.net.
  That is, you do not upload the tar.gz and zip to the WWW site, but do an
  FMPP release on SourceForge with the correct version number.

* Run `ant site`

* Upload the generated site.

4. Make the announcements where appropriate
